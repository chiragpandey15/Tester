# Tester

## Project Description
Tester is a robust program testing tool designed to enhance the quality and efficiency of software development. Built using C++ and shell script, Tester provides a comprehensive unit testing solution by generating random test cases and facilitating comparisons between an efficient program and a brute force solution. By automating the testing process, Tester significantly reduces the programmer's time by up to 30%, enabling them to focus on other critical aspects of development.

## Project Functionality
1. **Generate Random Test Cases**: Tester offers the ability to generate a large number of random test cases for validating the functionality and robustness of your program. By providing diverse inputs that cover various edge cases and scenarios, Tester helps ensure that your program performs reliably across different situations. This feature saves valuable time that would otherwise be spent manually creating test cases.

2. **Test Efficient Program vs. Brute Force Solution**: With Tester, you can compare the results of an efficient program against a brute force solution. This functionality allows you to verify the correctness and efficiency of your optimized code by comparing it with a straightforward, albeit slower, implementation. By identifying any discrepancies or performance gaps, Tester assists in fine-tuning your program for optimal performance and accuracy.

## Technology Stack
Tester leverages the following technologies:

- **C++**: The core functionality of Tester is implemented in C++. C++ provides the necessary tools and features for writing robust testing algorithms, interacting with the program under test, and performing comparisons between different solutions.

- **Shell Script**: The shell script component of Tester complements the C++ code by providing additional automation capabilities. Shell scripts can handle repetitive tasks, execute multiple test cases, and facilitate seamless integration with the command-line environment.

## Conclusion
Tester is a powerful program testing tool that simplifies and accelerates the unit testing process. By employing C++ and shell script, Tester enables the generation of random test cases and facilitates the comparison of an efficient program against a brute force solution. With its focus on automating testing procedures, Tester significantly reduces the programmer's workload, freeing up time for other critical development tasks. By leveraging this robust testing solution, developers can enhance the quality and reliability of their software while improving overall productivity.
